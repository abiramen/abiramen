<h2><center>Hey there!</center></h3>
I'm a recent graduate from <strong>UNSW Sydney</strong>. In my time as a student, I was also a tutor, course administrator and delivered over 35 hours of lectures for the first-year Systems Programming course, COMP1521, which I'm still involved with. Most of my commits at the moment are related to teaching, working on educational tools and (private) contributions to COMP1521 course materials/infrastructure.
