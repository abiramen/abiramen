<h3><center>Hey there!</center></h3>
I'm a student at **UNSW Sydney**, and most of my commits at the moment are related to coursework. 
### Current projects
- I'm working on [CSESoc UNSW's new website](https://github.com/csesoc/csesoc.unsw.edu.au).
- I write CTFs for [UNSW Security Society](https://www.unswsecurity.com).
- I'm very slowly working on my [website](https://www.abiram.me) because I have a lot of blog posts I want to write. :smile:
