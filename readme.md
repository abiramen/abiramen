<h2><center>Hey there!</center></h3>
I'm a third year student and casual academic at <strong>UNSW Sydney</strong>. Most of my commits at the moment are related to teaching, working on educational tools and (private) contributions to COMP1521 course materials/infrastructure.

<h3>Current projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm a course administrator at UNSW, primarily involved with teaching and the overall running of COMP1521, a systems programming course. I also occasionally contribute to <a href="https://github.com/insou22/mipsy">mipsy_web</a>, an education-focused browser-based MIPS32 emulator.
<li>I'm the President of, and also occasionally write CTFs for <a href = "https://unswsecurity.com">UNSW Security Society</a>.</li>
<li>I'm the Technical Director at <a href = "https://csesoc.unsw.edu.au">CSESoc UNSW</a>, where I'm primarily responsible for maintaining our infrastructure of several projects, and also discover potential vulnerabilities in various projects for fun.</li>
<li>I occasionally write articles on my <a href="https://www.abiram.me">website!</a> These include articles that I've written for other students.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Things I've done in the past</h3>
<li>I've worked on <a href = "https://github.com/csesoc/notangles">Notangles</a>, a timetable planner for UNSW students.</li>
<li>I've worked on <a href = "https://github.com/csesoc/csesoc.unsw.edu.au">CSESoc UNSW's new website</a>.</li>
<li>I've participated in a few hackathons with <a href = "https://github.com/cr4sh-0verr1ders/">this team</a>.</li>
